  - Except from 4 PM to 5 PM on each second day of the third week of any month - this must be reserved and unavailable

AREAS covered:
------------------
- Console application with structured folder approach.
- Meaningful naming convention used
- Dependency injection
- Entity Framework used

Areas needs improvement:
--------------------------
- Connecting string can be configured in Key vault(Assuming Keyvault is already ready for usage)
